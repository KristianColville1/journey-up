# python basics

#print
print('This will print out in the terminal')    # this is a function, print(), text within is a parameter

print("We can't forget.. Hello, World") # single or double quotes, preference...

# some variable types
string1 = 'This is a string'
string2 = 'This is another string'

int1 = 1 # this is an integer - whole number
float1 = 0.5 # this is a floating point - decimal number

# string manipulation and code intelligence
print('this is a line\nthis is a line\nthis is a line') # the \n creates a new line

print('this is a line' + ' and this is another line') # string concatenation, using the + operator

# more functions
#input('What is your name?') # takes user input

user = input("What is your name?") # assigning the users value to our user object
print("I hope you enjoy coding " + user) # prints to the terminal and prints user value, their name
